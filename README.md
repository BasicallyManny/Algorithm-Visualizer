# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work in real time, providing an interactive way to understand the mechanics of sorting.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Visualizes algorithms such as Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Interactive Visualization:** See the sorting process in action with animated bar heights representing values.
- **Customizable Array Size:** Adjust the array size to see how different algorithms handle varying input sizes.
- **Responsive Design:** The mobile-friendly app ensures a smooth experience on different devices.
- **Color Coding:** Uses color-coded bars to represent the sorting process:
  - **Cyan:** Default color for all bars.
  - **Green:** Highlighting the current element being processed.
  - **Red:** Highlighting comparisons between elements.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** This is for type safety and better development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsive design.
